# task-scheduler

## Description

This is the most simplest scheduler for user-level threads (fibers).  
I have just wanted to test Boost.Context library and explore something new.  

`TaskScheduler` manages task queue using algorithm `first come, first served`.  
There are also some interesing scheduling algorithms exist but this is the most simplest one to implement.
